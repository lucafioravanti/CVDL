## Goal
Classify different types of skin cancer based on dermoscopic images.

## Possible Datasource
[HAM10000 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000)

## Key Points
- The task involves:
  - Investigating the dataset
  - Reading about previous work
  - Developing and implementing your own solution
  - Presenting your results
- Your solution should not merely reproduce an existing solution, but it can build on what has been done so far. For example, you could approach the problem using novel architectures like vision transformers, as introduced in the lecture.
- Grading will not be based on the accuracy of your prototype but rather on the quality and quantity of your efforts.
